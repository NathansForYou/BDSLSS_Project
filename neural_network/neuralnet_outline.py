# Xx3 d-dimensional input layer
# Could use relative coordinates to other atoms, assume long vector of one dimension
# Rnadomly instantiate weight matrices for each depth layer
# Feed forward neural network, look for a similar example
# Project from small d-dimensional back to d-dimensional representations, each iteration
# increases the approximation layer
